# TODO

  - Add twinkling stars to background

  - Add intro animation for main pages, thinking of a quick typewriter effect maybe?

  - Build welcome game:
    - Takes an array of strings, each string is a 'level' in the game.
    - Each level, you must grab and drag stars that correspond with each word in the string, into the outlined string in the middle.
    - The stars twinkle, revealing what word they are momentarily.
    - After dropping a correct star in, the word lights up. Once the full string is lit up, that level is complete.
    - Once all levels are complete, navigate to the /about page.
    - Maybe a second array of words can be passed in as 'distractions'. These words are just incorrect words that also flash around, making it harder to find the correct ones. Might not be necessary.
