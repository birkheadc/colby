# TODO

  - Build About page
  - Quick spin nav if you quickly click on an icon.
  - Change hamburger icon to star maybe?
  - Look into different fonts, esp. for headers / links / buttons
  - Mobile formatting needs work. Atm, nav wheel is just too small. Also slider is doing weird things to the page's scaling.
  - Give each page of a slider it's own color, maybe based on it's title, or id so that it is random but the same every time
